### About This Project

This is a simple voice assistant. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I am developing this project for a few reasons:

- I don't personally like the privacy/convenience ratio of Alexa and other home assistants
- I want skills that other voice assistants don't have, and I don't feel like developing skills for those devices. Perhaps someday I will do that as a possible income stream, if the skills seem useful enough for enough people, but for now I just want to build things exactly for my own needs
- To keep in Python practice. Right now I work exclusively in Javascript, with a heavy emphasis on frontend, and I want to keep my hand in other technologies and paradigms
- To keep in writing practice. Publish or perish, as they say, and it's been a long time since I've written much of anything
- I enjoy modular projects like this, where it is really easy to add incremental improvements over time
- To get some raspberry pi experience. It's been years since I've touched any hardware, and I miss it. As of this writing, this voice assistant just runs from the command line on my laptop, but the ultimate goal is to put it into a pi or similar device and have a dedicated assistant
- Reduce screen time? In theory if I get all the planned skills up and running I'll be looking at my phone and navigating through different tabs less. The time saving there is probably nominal, though; this is mostly just a for-fun project
- Eventual language model integration experiments
