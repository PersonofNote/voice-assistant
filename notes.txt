Notes:

I think configuration should be handlable in my local .env file. I guess if I were gonna get fancy and handle multiples, I'd have each device know when it was turned on the first time.
It would register a UUID in a database somewhere and perform the setup configuration stuff, and load each from the db. 

But for privacy, I think I'd just want each piece of hardware to handle everything in its own .env file, right? 
Not sure about best practices there, but it seems like that would be best for a low number of devices that I'm not trying to build an evil empire off of.
